				<h2>As NASA’s Voyager 1 Surveys Interstellar Space, Its Density Measurements Are Making Waves</h2>
				<p>Until recently, every spacecraft in history had made all of its measurements inside our heliosphere, the magnetic 
				bubble inflated by our Sun. But on Aug. 25, 2012, NASA’s Voyager 1 changed that. As it crossed the heliosphere’s boundary, 
				it became the first human-made object to enter – and measure – interstellar space. Now eight years into 
				its interstellar journey, a close listen of Voyager 1’s data is yielding new insights into what that frontier is like.</p>
				<br>
				<p>If our heliosphere is a ship sailing interstellar waters, Voyager 1 is a life raft just dropped from the deck, determined 
				to survey the currents. For now, any rough waters it feels are mostly from our heliosphere’s wake. But farther out, it will 
				sense the stirrings from sources deeper in the cosmos. Eventually, our heliosphere’s presence will fade from its measurements completely.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Ocker’s new study, published on Monday in Nature Astronomy, reports what may be the first continuous measurement of the 
				density of material in interstellar space. “This detection offers us a new way to measure the density of interstellar space 
				and opens up a new pathway for us to explore the structure of the very nearby interstellar medium,” Ocker said</p>
